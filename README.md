## Installation
Head to the [ecommerce-back-end](https://github.com/crissyg923/ecommerce-back-end) repo and clone to your local environment.  Having an application like Insomnia will allow you to easily test these routes without a developed front end.

## Usage
This e-commerce back end application can be used to manage  website routes, including what is displayed when an endpoint is reached.  The best part is that it is scalable and the basic structure can be used as a guide for developing other sites with similar functionality.

## Credits
Rutgers tutors and office hours were a great help in the creation of this project.

## How to Contribute
Someone can contribute by developing a front-end or rearranging/editing code to make it run more efficiently.
